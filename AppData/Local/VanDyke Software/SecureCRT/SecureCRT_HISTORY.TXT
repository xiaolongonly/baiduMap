Changes in SecureCRT 7.3.4 (Official) -- June 16, 2015
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - If a tabbed session was closed while a transfer operation in that
    session was in progress, SecureCRT crashed.
  - When SecureCRT and SecureFX were integrated, if the configuration
    passphrase was changed in one application while the other
    application was running, the sensitive data could have been
    encrypted incorrectly.
  - The personal data folder could not be merged with the configuration
    folder if the personal data folder contained any empty session
    folders.
  - When the Session Manager was in autohide mode and a session was
    connected, if a menu was activated using the keyboard and dismissed
    by pressing ESC, and then the keyboard accelerator to display the
    Session Manager was pressed, the Session Manager gained focus but
    remained hidden.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT could crash when a smart card was used for
    authentication.
  - Windows: On Windows 10, the last line of the terminal session was
    partially hidden by the bottom of the application window.
  - Windows: On Windows 10, moving the SecureCRT window caused it to get
    smaller.
  - Windows: On Windows 10, every time a tiled session was connected, it
    shrunk by one row and one column.
  - Windows: On Windows 10, if the session rows and columns were changed
    in the Session Options dialog, the view size was one row and one
    column less than the specified values.
  - Windows: PKCS11 authentication failed with FortiToken ePass2003.
  - Windows: CAPI authentication failed with the Fortinet FTK300 token.
  - Mac: Due to a change in OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), there can be more
    than one $PATH, which meant that the $PATH variable used by
    SecureCRT might not have contained the expected paths.
  - Mac: If there were multiple SecureCRT application windows, the
    keyboard accelerators COMMAND+I and COMMAND+M did not work unless
    the Session Manager was open in all the SecureCRT windows.
  - Mac: The SecureCRT version should not have been displayed in the
    title bar for official releases.
  - Mac/Linux: In the Manage Agent Keys dialog, if all keys were removed
    and then the Remove button was pressed again, SecureCRT crashed.
  - Mac/Linux: The Help contents, search, and glossary were not
    available.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3.3 (Official) -- March 31, 2015
-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Previous versions of SecureCRT supported saving passwords and other
    sensitive data.  In order to improve the security of this feature,
    SecureCRT now requires a passphrase to be created the first time
    version 7.3.3 runs.  This passphrase will be used to encrypt and
    decrypt sensitive data stored in the session database, such as
    passwords and send/expect logon scripts.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT hung if logon actions were being edited for multiple
    sessions and one of the strings being replaced was blank.
  - The crash reporter dialog, which reports crashes for previous runs
    of SecureCRT, was being displayed after the SecureCRT window was
    displayed, which caused confusion about when the crash had occurred.
  - SSH1: If the "Auto reconnect" global option was set and a session
    that did not have the username and/or password saved got
    disconnected, if the user did not respond to the username or
    password prompts, multiple prompts were displayed until SecureCRT
    eventually crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3.2 (Official) -- February 26, 2015
----------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The escape sequence ESC E (DECNEL, next line) is treated like a CR
    (or CRLF) so that the command on that line gets logged.
  - SSH2: When attempting to authenticate using a CAPI key or certificate
    with a smart card, if the card returns an error, SecureCRT attempts
    to continue authentication, which allows authentication to succeed
    with certain smart cards, such as GoldKey.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when attempting to run a Perl script using
    ActiveState ActivePerl 5.18 and 5.20.  SecureCRT still cannot run the
    script.  Switching ActivePerl 5.16 is recommended.
  - When the global option "Save window state for each session" was set
    and SecureCRT was in full-screen mode, if a local shell session was
    opened or a session was cloned, SecureCRT went out of full-screen
    mode.
  - If autohide was on for the session manager, the most recently opened
    session was not selected when the session manager was shown again.
  - If a keymap was modified through a script, it was not always
    reloaded.
  - When using the Connect dialog, if a session with saved credentials
    was connected by double clicking, extraneous text appeared in the
    session window before the prompt.
  - Telnet: When connected to a session with a character or line send
    delay specified, the delay was not honored when a script sent a
    string.
  - Windows: On Windows 8.1, SecureCRT crashed if TAPI was selected as
    the protocol in the Quick Connect dialog and the Configure button was
    pressed.
  - Mac/Linux: If a local shell session was started from an alias, it was
    not possible to interrupt output using CTRL+C.
  - Mac/Linux: If the global option "Show horizontal scroll bar" was set
    and the connected session had the session options "Show horizontal
    scroll bar" and "Synchronize view to size" set, after performing a
    long directory list that filled the screen, the last row had extra
    space below it.
  - Mac/Linux: The crash reporter dialog did not show crash information
    for the most recent crash.
  - Linux: The background color of the space to the right of the tabbed
    sessions in the tab bar was the background color of the default
    session's color scheme instead of the background color of the tabs.
  - Linux: The global INI-file-only option "Toolbar Style" was not
    honored if it was set to a value other than 2.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3.1 (Official) -- December 4, 2014
---------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - In order to address the POODLE attack, SSL 3.0 is disabled by
    default.
  - SSH2: When using public-key authentication, if the .PUB file is
    not present, it is created automatically so that agent will work.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could hang when attempting to stop using a personal
    data folder.
  - Quotes were not supported in regular expressions used for keyword
    highlighting.
  - If the global option "Exit when last session is disconnected" was
    set and the session option "Clear on disconnect" was set for a
    session and that session was connected twice, if one of the
    sessions was disconnected, it was not cleared.
  - It was possible to activate the menu bar using a keyboard
    accelerator when the menu bar was disabled.
  - Windows: The 32-bit version of SecureCRT could crash when the
    "Prompt send delay" option was set for the session and text was
    pasted into the session.
  - Windows: The "Default.mnu" file did not include "Update Now" in
    the Help menu.
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed when attempting to create a Telnet session
    that used an SSH1 or SSH2 session as a firewall.
  - Mac: X11 forwarding did not work with XQuartz on Mac OS 10.10
    (Yosemite).
  - Mac/Linux: After dragging a tabbed session within the application
    window to change its order, it was no longer possible to drag a
    tabbed session to a different window.
  - Mac/Linux: SecureCRT did not honor the shell setting for a local
    shell when it was set by the "chsh" command.
  - Mac/Linux: If focus was in the session manager when it was closed,
    it remained there.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Official) -- October 23, 2014
-------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Mac: The keyboard shortcut COMMAND+N opens a new window when
    the main application window has focus as it did in version 7.2.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT crashed when attempting display the information for an
    incorrectly formatted SSH host key.
  - Windows: Selecting the "Update Now" menu item did not reset the
    clock used to check for updates every 30 days.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 5) -- October 2, 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - In order to prevent potential data loss, merging the personal data
    store with the configuration folder is only done if the session
    structure is exactly the same for both.

Bug fixes:

  - After a session failed to connect because the SSH2 server was not
    available and the session was changed to use Telnet and logon
    actions were added, SecureCRT crashed when attempting to connect to
    the modified session.
  - The previously selected session was not remembered when the session
    manager was closed and re-opened.
  - Windows/Mac: Complex regular expressions used for keyword
    highlighting could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - Mac: The "Connect in Tab" icon in the session manager did not look
    correct on OS X Yosemite (10.10) Retina displays.
  - Mac: The clear button in the session filter edit box was very small
    on Retina displays.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 4) -- September 23, 2014
-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows: Added an "Update Now" menu item to see if a new version of
    SecureCRT is available and if there is, clicking a button downloads
    and installs it.

Changes:

  - The maximum length for a regular expression for keyword highlighting
    was increased to 256 characters.
  - Substitution paramters such as ${VDS_INSTALL_PATH} can be used in a
    script filename.
  - Mac: Since the minimize and zoom buttons were always grayed out,
    they are hidden when SecureCRT is used with the Moom session manager.

Bug fixes:

  - If a regular expression that caused everything to be highlighted was
    specified for a session and the session window was made narrow enough
    for command output to wrap, some words did not get highlighted.
  - If the width of the session manager was resized while it was in
    autohide mode, the new width was not saved when SecureCRT exited.
  - If autohide mode was on for the session manager, then the session
    manager was closed and reopened and autohide was turned off,
    changing any value in the Session Options dialog caused autohide
    to be turned back on.
  - In the Keyword List Properties dialog, if a keyword was selected
    when a new word was added, pressing the "Set Color" button and
    selecting a color caused the previously selected and new keyword to
    be changed.
  - In the Keyword List Properties dialog, after changing the color for
    a keyword, the keyword was not highlighted in the keyword list.
  - Mac: If the Connect dialog was used instead of the Session Manager,
    using the keyboard shortcut COMMAND+I to move focus to the session
    filter box caused SecureCRT to crash.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 3) -- September 9, 2014
------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added a search filter to the Connect dialog, which helps find
    sessions quickly, especially when a large number of sessions have
    been saved.

Changes:

  - The logic used for matching word delimiters was improved so that
    keyword and regular expressions (Windows and Mac only) that
    contain word delimiters do not affect keywords and regular
    expressions that do not contain word delimiters.
  - The order of keywords can now be specified for keyword
    highlighting.
  - SSH2: The modulus for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithms
    can be set from 1024 to 8192.

Bug fixes:

  - Saved passwords could be deleted inadvertently by pressing ENTER
    when focus was in the Password field of the Password Properties
    dialog.
  - When using the filter bar to search for sessions, the session
    tree did not return to the original state if the option "Save
    expanded folder state in connect dialog" was off.
  - Windows/Mac: When more than one rule (e.g., a keyword and a
    regular expression) matched a word, sometimes the word was not
    highlighted using the right color.
  - Windows: Cloned sessions were opened to the right of all sessions
    instead of immediately to the right of the original session.
  - Mac: The keyboard shortcut COMMAND+N opened a new window when
   "Open in a tab" was selected.
  - Linux: SecureCRT crashed if /script was specified on the command 
    line.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 2) -- August 26, 2014
----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - ANSI emulation now supports the CHA sequence (CSI pn G).
  - The keyboard shortcut CTRL+A can be used to select all text in
    the Send String field in the Map Button dialog.
  - In the session manager, when text is entered in the filter bar,
    the first matching session gets selected.
  - Windows: In the session manager, the filter bar can be cleared by
    pressing the ESCAPE key or the "X" button.

Bug fixes:

  - Mac: SecureCRT could crash when sessions were dragged between
    application windows.
  - Mac: SecureCRT crashed if focus was in the filter bar and
    SecureCRT was closed using CMD+Q.
  - Mac: If a three-finger swipe was used to select text in the
    terminal window and then CMD+V was used to paste, the wrong text
    was pasted or pasting was very slow.
  - Mac: Attempting to convert a private key to OpenSSH format failed
    to export the key.
  - Mac: If there was text in the clipboard and the Find dialog was
    accessed using CMD+F, pressing CMD+V caused the text to be  pasted
    in the terminal session rather than the Find dialog.
  - Linux: SecureCRT crashed if the session manager was enabled and
    SecureCRT was closed using ALT+F4.
  - Linux: When sessions were tiled, pressing ALT+ENTER on a session
    in the session manager did not open the session properties dialog.
  - Mac/Linux: In the session manager, if the filter bar was cleared
    after being used to filter sessions, the session tree was not
    restored to its original state.
  - Mac/Linux: Focus could be incorrectly taken out of the connect bar
    when the session manager was automatically hidden.
  - Mac/Linux: The Export Settings and Import Settings dialogs did not
    automatically scroll when the progress information was displayed.


Changes in SecureCRT 7.3 (Beta 1) -- August 7, 2014
---------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Windows/Mac: Added support for regular expressions in keyword
    highlighting.
  - Added the ability to specify colors for keyword highlighting.
  - In keyword highlighting, the styles (reverse video, bold, and
    color) can be combined.
  - Added the ability to edit keywords used for keyword highlighting.
  - Added support for exporting and importing SecureCRT settings to
    and from XML, which makes it easier to copy settings from one
    machine to another.
  - Mac/Linux: Added a session manager that can be used in place of
    the modal Connect dialog.  The session manager can be in a pane
    in the SecureCRT window or can be an undocked modeless dialog.
  - Added a search filter to the session manager, which helps find
    sessions quickly, especially when a large number of sessions have
    been saved.
  - Added the ability to connect to a remote system through a named
    pipe.
  - Added the ability to script Kermit file transfers.
  - Added the ability to specify the substitution parameter %USERNAME%
    as a session username.
  - Added a new session option "Position cursor on left click" that
    allows the mouse to move the cursor to a different location.
  - Added a new session option "Enable alternate screen switching".
  - Added an option to disable the hover text for buttons on the button
    bar.
  - Added a new menu item "Close All Sessions" to the tab menu, which
    allows all sessions to be closed without closing the SecureCRT
    window.
  - Added a new global option "Exit SecureCRT when last session is
    closed" that specifies whether or not the SecureCRT window should
    be closed when the last session is closed.
  - Added a global option to swap ENTER and CTRL+ENTER in the command
    (chat) window.
  - Added the ability for the command (chat) window to be controlled
    independently in each SecureCRT window.
  - Mac: Added support for Finder tags.

Changes:

  - Added the ability to store keys larger than 2048 bits in agent.
  - Added the ability to generate keys larger than 2048 bits.
  - When connecting a session, if there's an agent key associated
    with the session, it is tried first.  This can help prevent a
    session from failing to connect because the maximum number of
    authentication retries was exceeded.
  - The MD5 and SHA-1 fingerprints are now displayed in dialogs that
    show host key information.
  - When multiple sessions are being edited, if a single expect or send
    string is changed in the session automated logon option, only the
    single string is changed in all the sessions.  Previously, the
    entire expect/send block was written to the sessions.
  - Added the ability to send a disconnected session to a new window.
  - Log files are saved with a .log extension by default unless a
    different extension is specified.
  - Font information was added to the information stored in the
    personal data folder.
  - Mac: The folder used when a key or button is mapped to
    MENU_LOG_SESSION is the same as the folder used when "Log
    Session" is selected from the File menu.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash if multiple sessions specified the same
    session as a firewall (i.e., jump host).
  - SecureCRT could crash when the send delay "Prompt" option was set
    and a large amount of text was pasted into a session.
  - SecureCRT could crash when several GNS3 sessions were connected in
    rapid succession.
  - SecureCRT could hang if a partial execute escape sequence was
    received.
  - When using mcedit (Midnight Commander editor), incorrect text was
    selected when switching between multiple screens or if the SHIFT
    key was down and the mouse moved, which caused incorrect text to
    be pasted.
  - If a session was resized and then another session was opened,
    the application window was changed to the size before the
    session was resized.
  - When a color scheme that was being used by two or more open sessions
    was changed from the Session Options dialog, only the active tab was
    updated to reflect the change.
  - If a button was mapped to the menu function
    CLEAR_SCREEN_AND_SCROLLBACK, if the SHIFT key was held while the
    button was clicked, only the current session was cleared.
  - If the system resolution was changed while SecureCRT was running,
    the font information in the Session Options dialog did not get
    updated.
  - TAPI: If sessions were copied from one machine to another and the
    the modem in the TAPI sessions did not exist, SecureCRT did not
    indicate that there was a problem when the session was edited and
    displayed a cryptic error when attempting to connect.
  - Windows: Deleting the same session from multiple instances of
    SecureCRT using the session manager could cause all the sessions
    to be deleted.
  - Windows: If the "Black" display theme was being used by SecureCRT
    and RDP was used to connect from another system to the local system
    and then closed, SecureCRT's title bar was missing.
  - Windows: When using the session manager, if the default session
    was changed to include a username and a session was connected,
    SecureCRT prompted for the username.
  - Mac/Linux: SecureCRT could hang or cause 100% CPU usage when the
    terminal protocol was changed.
  - Mac/Linux: If the posix directory was a symbolic link, it caused
    SecureCRT to hang when attempting to open the Session Options
    dialog.
  - Mac/Linux: When specifying a log file for a session, if the
    filter was set to "*.txt", a ".log" extension was used instead.
  - Mac/Linux: If SecureCRT and SecureFX were running and a change was
    made to the global or session options in one of the applications,
    the changes were not picked up by the other application.
